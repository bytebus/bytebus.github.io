    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I&rsquo;m currently working an Extbase-Extension for TYPO3 4.7, I had to debug some backend code. I didn&rsquo;t find anything on how to set this up with <a href="http://xdebug.org/">Xdebug</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a>, so I&rsquo;ll write it down here.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>XDebug has to be installed and configured to work with PHPStorm, which works out fine with the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/webhelp/configuring-xdebug.html">official docs</a>. I assume that Xdebug and PHPStorm are tested and working.</p>

<h2>Symlinks</h2>

<p>Typo3 4.7 can be installed as usual, but you want to physically put the <code>typo3_src</code> folder into your webroot instead of just symlinking to it. This caused quite some headache while setting it up.</p>

<p>The webroot folder should look like this regarding symlinks:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>webroot/
</span><span class='line'>  typo3_src/
</span><span class='line'>  t3lib &gt; typo3_src/t3lib/
</span><span class='line'>  typo3 &gt; typo3_src/typo3/
</span><span class='line'>  index.php &gt; typo3_src/index.php</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>PHPStorm setup</h2>

<h3>Directories</h3>

<p>When setting up the PHPStorm project you should choose your webroot folder as the <em>Content root</em> of your project. It would have been even better to select your plugin folder as <em>Content root</em> and only include the core sources, but there was no obvious way to get it done.</p>

<p>You can check this by opening the project settings in the Menu <em>Directories</em>.</p>

<h3>Path mappings</h3>

<p>In the symlink setup above, the folders <code>t3lib</code> and <code>typo3</code> as well as the <code>ìndex.php</code> were symlinked inside the <code>typo3_src</code> folder. We don&rsquo;t have to make a physical copy of them that way, but we have to tell PHPStorm about it.</p>

<p>You can do this in the project settings, look for the submenu <em>Servers</em> inside <em>PHP</em>. You will have to setup a server now if you haven&rsquo;t already. Activate the &ldquo;Use path mappings&rdquo; option. For each path in your project, you can now specify it&rsquo;s absolute path by filling the column in the mappings table. Specify the absolute path inside <code>typo3_src</code> for the two symlinked directories and the symlinked <code>index.php</code>.</p>

<p>Set up theses mappings:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>Project path &gt; Absolute path on the server
</span><span class='line'>------------------------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>/path/to/webroot &gt; /path/to/webroot
</span><span class='line'>  t3lib &gt; /path/to/webroot/typo3_src/t3lib
</span><span class='line'>  typo3 &gt; /path/to/webroot/typo3_src/typo
</span><span class='line'>  index.php &gt; /path/to/webroot/typo3_src/index.php</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that the path for the webroot was mapped to it&rsquo;s own path. While testing this seemed to be necessary.</p>

<h3>One more mapping</h3>

<p>Also check the URL mapping by navigating to <em>Deployment</em> in your project settings. You will have to create a deployment server configuration if you haven&rsquo;t already. Make sure, that you have a mapping for your webroot by entering your webroot&rsquo;s path into the <code>Local path</code> field and <code>/</code> into the <code>Web path on server: xyz</code> field.</p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s it!</h2>

<p>The setup isn&rsquo;t too complicated, but there are enough possibilities to make something wrong, which I apparently did in almost all cases.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/marklets/">bookmarklets</a> and breakpoints to quickly debug your code on the fly. If you are not sure where to start, look for the <code>webroot/index.php</code> for the frontend and <code>webroot/typo3/index.php</code> to get you started. Also have a look at the <em>Network</em> tab of your devtools: a lot of requests are initiated on other endpoints like <code>webroot/typo3/alt_doc.php</code> or <code>webroot/typo3/mod.php</code> and a lot of others.</p>

<p>Also stay aware of the fact that the TYPO3 backend is made up of nested iFrames (which is slightly awkward&hellip;). If you want to reinitiate a request, it is probably better to right click into the concerned area and choose <em>Reload frame</em> than reloading the whole page which leaves you with the dashboard.</p>

<p>After writing down all of this I have to add one more thing: debugging software really is the most effective way to effectively learn, what it does. So yes, it is worth all the hassle of setting it up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there. I just recognized, that I need some kind of blog to not forget things I do/like/don&rsquo;t like. Most of these things have something to do with web development since that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>

<p>I always wanted to work with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> made me use it in minutes until now. So, let&rsquo;s see, where this is going.</p>
