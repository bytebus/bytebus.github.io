Hello, my name is Marc Löhe and write up stuff into this blog to not forget about things.

I do web development as a freelancer in Münster, Germany and I want the free and open web to win. You can find out slightly more about my work on that [other website][1].

Contact me via [Github][2], [Twitter][3], or a plain old [email][4].
