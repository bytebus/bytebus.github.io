Hello, I'm Marc Löhe and write up stuff into this blog to not forget about things.

I do web development freelancing in Münster, Germany and I really want the web to win. You can find out slightly more about my work on that [other website][1].

You can also contact me via [Github][2], [Twitter][3], or a plain old [email][4].
